// TRIE
// A tree-like data structure whose nodes store the letters of an alphabet. Words 
// and strings can be retrieved from the structure by traversing down a branch path. 
// Tries ALWAYS HAVE an empty root node, with links to other nodes for each alphabetic 
// value.The number of child nodes is directly connected to how many values are 
// possible.
