// LINKED LIST
// A linear data structure where each element is a separate object(node). Each element 
// of the list comprises of two items: the data and the reference to the next node. The 
// last node has reference to null.The entry point into a linked list is called the 
// head. A Linked List can be singly - linked, or doubly - linked where nodes consist 
// of data, next, and prev.
