// GRAPH
// A nonlinear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.The nodes (also referred 
// to as vertices) are connected by edges(lines).

// Differences from a tree: A graph can have undirectional and bidirectional paths 
// between nodes, while a tree can only have one path between two vertices(nodes). 
// In a tree, there is only one root node and every child can only have one parent, 
// while in a graph there is no root node.
