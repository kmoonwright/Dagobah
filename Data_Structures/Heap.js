// HEAP
// A complete tree in which all nodes are in a specific order. A heap is a maximally 
// efficient implementation of a priority queue.
    
//     TYPES:
//     Max-Heap - The root node must be greater than all of its children. The value 
//         of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent.The same must 
//         be recursively true for all sub-trees in the Binary Tree.

//     Min-Heap: The root node must be less than all of its children. The value of each 
//         node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent. The same must be 
//         recursively true for all sub-trees in the Binary Tree.
