ARRAYS
Binary Search - only works on sorted arraysâ€¦
	Time Complexity: O(log n)
	Space Complexity: O(n)
	

GRAPHS
Depth-First Search
	A traversing algorithm for searching tree or graph data structures. Starting at the root node, DFS searches the entire node branch down to its leaf before being forced to backtrack and expand to other nodes.

	Time Complexity: O(n^2)
	Space Complexity: O(n^2)
	

Breadth-First Search
	A traversing algorithm for searching tree or graph data structures. Starting at the root node, BFS explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
