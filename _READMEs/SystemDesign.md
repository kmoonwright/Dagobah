# SYSTEM DESIGN


INTRODUCTION
Key Points:
	Ask good questions - MVP (minimum viable product)
		Define the feature set
		Define scalability of the system
			How much data needs to be stored? How many requests need to be handled? What sort of latency is expected?
	Don't use buzzwordsâ€¦
		Only speak about technologies and data structures you have in-depth knowledge of
	Clear and organized thinking
		Have a large overview of the entire system before going into detail
		Define all API's, who are the actors for the system
	Drive discussions
		You should be talking 80% of the time, interviewer 20% of the time
		Lead the discussion and preempt potential issues
